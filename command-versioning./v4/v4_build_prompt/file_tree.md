FILE SYSTEM SOURCE OF TRUTH
This is the canonical file tree and change ledger.
It records every file/folder, the CMT-ID that created or modified it, and any removals.

🔐 Rules:

ALWAYS check before creating/editing any file.

NEVER add duplicate or unregistered files.

ALL changes (create/edit/delete) must be logged here.

Preserve historical files as (removed) if deleted, never erased from the log.
