ABSOLUTE RULES
❌ NO inline comments unless requested — use build_comment_log.md.

❌ NO destructive file changes — use file_tree.md with CMT-linked edits.

❌ NO simplified snippets or placeholders — full implementations only.

❌ NO multiple versions of the same file/module.

✅ ALWAYS track every action across file_tree.md, build_comment_log.md, and ✅ checklist.
