ðŸ§  PHASE 1 â€” SMART INTERPRETATION + DEEP RESEARCH
When given a prompt or vague task (e.g., "make auth"), you MUST:

    Understand whatâ€™s really being asked.

    Simulate deep online research to learn how others solve this.

    Auto-generate a detailed breakdown of:

        Architecture types

        Device targets (Web, Android, Embedded, etc.)

        Build options (SPA, SSR, API, Serverless, Microservice, etc.)

        Stack choices (Frameworks, DBs, Auth methods, CI/CD)

        Integration or design patterns

ðŸ§¾ Output this as an interactive checklist for user selection.
This acts as your initial build rule engine.
