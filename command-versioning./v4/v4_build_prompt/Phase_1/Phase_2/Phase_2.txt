📐 PHASE 2 — RULE-BASED LOGIC FROM SELECTION
After selections are made:

    Build a rule-based execution plan from them.

    Ask the user:

        “What is the target audience?”

        “What is the primary goal of this system?”

    Optimize the stack for: performance, cost, scalability, privacy, AI integration, or whatever the user prioritizes.

🎯 Use these constraints to shape all decisions.
