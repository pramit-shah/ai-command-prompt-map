## 🔍 STRICT COMPARISON: v4.1 vs v5

| 🔢 Feature                                | ✅ v4.1 (Current)                                               | 🚀 v5 (Proposed)                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Project Tree Tracker (`file_tree.md`)** | ✔️ Yes – canonical, non-destructive, AI uses it before editing | ✔️ Same, but suggests live edit simulation                                    |
| **Comment Log (`build_comment_log.md`)**  | ✔️ Yes – full rationale, linked to every code change           | ✔️ Yes, adds improvement logs and change history                              |
| **CMT-ID + Status Management**            | ✔️ CMT-ID per change, tracked with status markers              | ✔️ Same, but encourages AI to *learn* from it                                 |
| **Checklist System**                      | ✔️ Smart To-Do list with real statuses (✅ 🟡 🔄 🧯 ⏳)          | ✔️ Same, no changes needed                                                    |
| **Feedback Engine**                       | ✔️ Deep research + user-selectable options                     | ✔️ Same, but modularizes feedback into a reusable decision map                |
| **User Selection Flow**                   | ✔️ Excel-like build picker, device type, target audience, etc. | ✔️ Same, with potential “build profiles” (e.g., Rapid MVP, Enterprise)        |
| **Modular Build Structure**               | ✔️ Structured: /src, /api, /models, etc.                       | ✔️ Same, but adds Module Registry to log reusable components                  |
| **Waypoint Memory**                       | ✔️ Yes – AI remembers where it left off                        | ✔️ Same, with post-phase summaries                                            |
| **Inline Comment Policy**                 | ❌ Avoided unless explicitly allowed                            | ❌ Same – pushes everything to external logs                                   |
| **Refactor System**                       | ✔️ Non-destructive: all changes are referenced, not overwrites | ✔️ Same, adds more rigor to the patch/change delta system                     |
| **AI Self-Awareness**                     | 🚫 Absent                                                      | ✅ Added “AI Post-Build Reflection” after each phase to learn/improve          |
| **Module Reuse Awareness**                | 🚫 Absent                                                      | ✅ Tracks reusable modules via MOD-ID and dependency graph                     |
| **Live Editable Workspace**               | 🚫 Not modeled                                                 | ✅ AI simulates editing existing files in a safe patch-oriented flow           |
| **AI Decision Map**                       | 🚫 Not included                                                | ✅ Visualized tree of why choices were made, what was rejected, what’s pending |
| **Roadmap Generation**                    | 🚫 Not part of the prompt                                      | ✅ Adds `PROJECT_ROADMAP.md` with milestones, phases, risks, dependencies      |
| **Export Modes (Packaging)**              | 🚫 Not defined                                                 | ✅ Promotes easy export commands: `export full`, `export current`, `zip all`   |

## 🍒 CHERRY-PICK STRATEGY: BUILD PROMPT v4.1.1 (Best Hybrid)

| ✅ Keep from v4.1                             | 🔁 Replace/Improve with v5 Features                                       |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✔️ `file_tree.md` and `build_comment_log.md` | 🔁 Add `MOD-ID` reuse tracker + patch history                             |
| ✔️ CMT-ID tracking + status system           | 🔁 Add “AI Post-Build Reflection” per checkpoint/phase                    |
| ✔️ Feedback + Rule-Driven Build + Checklist  | 🔁 Inject “AI Decision Map” into feedback engine                          |
| ✔️ Modular folders + waypoints               | 🔁 Add Roadmap Generator (`PROJECT_ROADMAP.md`) for long builds           |
| ✔️ Non-destructive, clean output formatting  | 🔁 Add simulated `LIVE_WORKSPACE` edit mode (read from tree, not rewrite) |
| ❌ No inline comments by default              | 🚫 Stay the same – enforce external tracking                              |
| 🚫 Profiles/Modes not present                | ✅ Optional: Add build profiles like `Mode: MVP`, `Mode: Mobile`, etc.     |

## ✅ FINAL VERDICT

If you want:

* **Stability & Proven Foundation** → Stick with **v4.1**
* **Ambition & AI Self-Improvement** → Adopt **v5**

If you want both:

* ✅ Use **v4.1.1 Hybrid**, which cherry-picks:

  * `AI Post-Build Reflection`
  * `MOD-ID reuse table`
  * `AI Decision Map`
  * `PROJECT_ROADMAP.md`
  * Optional: `LIVE_WORKSPACE` virtual patching
