## 🔍 RULES FOR AI

- ALWAYS check this file before modifying anything.
- BEFORE adding new files, confirm it doesn’t exist here.
- ON update, log the change with a new `CMT-ID`.
- ON delete, mark the file as `(removed)` but keep historical record.
- NEVER create a file outside this tree without user approval.

---

## 📌 WHY THIS MATTERS

- Prevents **structure fragmentation**
- Prevents **multiple versions** of same module
- Ensures **cross-file dependencies stay intact**
- Allows **AI to repair itself** after mistake via traceable map
- Enables **future process automation**, cross-process coordination, and systemic thinking

---

## 🔁 FUTURE-UPGRADE COMPATIBLE

This structure supports:
- Real-time diffing
- Auto-synchronization with Git
- Integration with file watchers, deployment logs, or audit systems
- Cross-process AI debugging

---

## 🔐 LOCKED STRUCTURE NOTE

Once this file is created, **no AI system may build blindly**. All edits must pass through the `file_tree.md` and be referenced in `build_comment_log.md`.

This guarantees intelligent building, modularity, and reflection.

### ✅ FINALIZED SUPER BUILD SYSTEM NOW INCLUDES:

1. **Super Build Prompt (v3)**
2. `build_comment_log.md` — 🧠 Full rationale + ID chain
3. `file_tree.md` — 📂 Canonical file source of truth
4. ✅ Checklist tracking with ✅ / 🔄 / ⏳ / 🧯
5. 📍 Waypoint memory + modular edits only
6. ❌ No overwriting unless traced and justified

**Ready to activate this full system and begin a new project build?**  
I’ll initialize the project root, create `file_tree.md`, `build_comment_log.md`, and output Phase 1: Research + Feedback Interface.
